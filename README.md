# To-Do-List
This To-Do List website is primarily created by me as a personal project to enhance my web development skills. While most of the design and functionality is my own work, I did seek help from AI for finalizing a few details and resolving some logical errors that arose during development. One of the key features I implemented in this project is the ability to move tasks between different categories, which adds a layer of interactivity and usability. This project allowed me to learn and experiment with JavaScript while also improving my problem-solving skills.
